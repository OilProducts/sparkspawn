# Sparkspawn

Sparkspawn is a DOT-driven workflow runner for multi-stage AI pipelines, with a FastAPI backend and React UI for authoring, execution, and run inspection.

## Description

Sparkspawn lets you define workflows as directed graphs (DOT), run them with built-in handlers (codergen, tool, conditional, fan-in, parallel, human gate), and inspect status, events, checkpoints, context, and artifacts from the web UI.

## Features

- DOT-first workflow model with parser, formatter, and validator
- Live run monitoring with SSE and run history
- Human-in-the-loop question/answer flow over HTTP
- Artifact browsing, including Graphviz pipeline render output
- Wheel distribution with `sparkspawn` CLI entrypoint

## Installation

Build and install from source:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run build
./scripts/sync_ui_dist.sh
uv build
pip install dist/sparkspawn-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Runtime prerequisites:

- `codex` CLI on `PATH` (for codergen backends)
- Graphviz `dot` on `PATH` (for graph SVG artifacts)

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
sparkspawn serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Optional runtime path overrides (CLI args or env vars):

- `SPARKSPAWN_DATA_DIR`
- `SPARKSPAWN_RUNS_DIR`
- `SPARKSPAWN_FLOWS_DIR`
- `SPARKSPAWN_UI_DIR`

Open: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## API

Key endpoints:

- `POST /pipelines`
- `GET /pipelines/{id}`
- `GET /pipelines/{id}/events`
- `GET /pipelines/{id}/graph`
- `GET /pipelines/{id}/checkpoint`
- `GET /pipelines/{id}/context`

npm --prefix frontend run test:unit
```

## Roadmap

- Improve packaging ergonomics (release workflow, docs polish)
- Add runtime `doctor` checks for external binary dependencies
- Continue UI parity and contract hardening

## Contributing

- Fork and create a feature branch.
- Keep changes scoped and test-backed.
- Run `uv run pytest -q` before opening a PR.

## Support
