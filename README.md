# Spark

Spark is a workspace workbench for AI-assisted software delivery. It combines a FastAPI backend and React UI for registering local projects, authoring shared DOT workflows, running them against a selected project context, and coordinating project conversations, flow requests, and run launches.

## What Spark Does

- Register local project directories and persist project-scoped conversation and review state
- Author shared workspace workflows as DOT graphs, either visually or in raw DOT
- Parse, canonicalize, validate, and save flows through the backend
- Run project-aware pipelines with built-in handlers such as `codergen`, `tool`, `conditional`, `parallel`, `parallel.fan_in`, `wait.human`, and `stack.manager_loop`
- Stream live run events, inspect checkpoints and context, browse artifacts, and answer human-gate questions
- Work inside project-scoped AI conversation threads that can request or directly launch project-scoped workflow runs
- Review and approve flow run requests, or launch a run directly from the conversation surface

## Main User Workflow

1. Register or select a local project in Home.
2. Open or resume a project conversation thread.
3. Ask Spark to inspect the project, answer questions, or prepare a flow run request.
4. Review and approve the flow run request, or launch a flow directly from the conversation.
5. Monitor execution in the Execution and Runs views.

The UI also supports a direct authoring workflow: Home -> Editor -> Execution -> Runs.
Flow authoring is workspace-global rather than project-owned: you can open the Editor without selecting a project, while the Execution view keeps run-start actions disabled until a project context is selected. Trigger automation is also workspace-global and lives in its own top-level Triggers tab rather than inside project settings.

For flow authoring, use this progression:

- Hands-on tutorial: [docs/first-flow-tutorial.md](docs/first-flow-tutorial.md)
- Product overview and authoring heuristics: this README
- Full raw DOT reference: [src/spark/guides/dot-authoring.md](src/spark/guides/dot-authoring.md)
- Task-oriented CLI/API operations guide: [src/spark/guides/spark-operations.md](src/spark/guides/spark-operations.md)

When working from a source checkout, validate direct flow edits with `uv run spark flow validate --file /path/to/flow.dot --text`.

## Flow Building Guide

Start with the smallest flow that matches the job:

Examples:

- [src/spark/flows/examples/simple-linear.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/simple-linear.dot): one pass through plan -> implement -> summarize
- [src/spark/flows/examples/implement-review-loop.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/implement-review-loop.dot): plan -> implement -> review with an actual retry loop
- [src/spark/flows/examples/human-review-loop.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/human-review-loop.dot): explicit human approval or requested fixes
- [src/spark/flows/examples/parallel-review.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/parallel-review.dot): fan-out / fan-in structure
- [src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/supervised-implementation.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/supervised-implementation.dot): parent/child composition with `stack.manager_loop`

Packaged workflows:

- [src/spark/flows/implement-from-plan.dot](src/spark/flows/implement-from-plan.dot): snapshot a plan file into `.spark/planflows/<run>/plan-source.md` plus `.spark/planflows/<run>/state.json`, expose that workspace via `context.planflow.*`, implement it, evaluate completion, and iterate
- [src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-spec.dot](src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-spec.dot): greenfield spec-implementation program flow that keeps repo-local state under `.specflow/` and dispatches milestone workers

Use the flow `goal` as the user-facing stated goal for the run:

- In prompts and flow descriptions, write to the “stated goal”, not internal engine names like `graph.goal`.
- Direct runs from the editor currently use the flow's saved `goal`.
- Workspace chat run requests and `uv run spark convo run-request --goal/--goal-file` can override that stated goal per run.

Use `launch_context` when one goal string is not enough:

- `launch_context` is first-class initial run state under `context.*`, not a prompt-only hack.
- Use it for structured launch details like request summaries, target paths, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- Workspace run requests accept `launch_context`, and `uv run spark convo run-request --launch-context-json/--launch-context-file` can populate it.
- Keep launch keys stable and semantic, for example `context.request.summary`, `context.request.target_paths`, and `context.request.acceptance_criteria`.
- In the flow editor, declare these inputs in Graph Settings -> Launch Inputs so direct execution can render a launch form from the flow itself.

Keep nodes single-purpose:

- A good node usually does one job: plan, implement, review, summarize, wait for human input, or supervise a child flow.
- Avoid combining planning, implementation, and review into one prompt if you want meaningful routing and retries.
- Prefer explicit labels on decision edges so the graph stays readable in the editor and run artifacts.

Pass context forward intentionally:

- Later nodes do not automatically understand why an earlier node was unhappy. If a stage should guide a later stage, it should emit `context_updates`.
- Use stable keys under `context.*` for cross-node feedback, for example `context.review.summary`, `context.review.required_changes`, and `context.review.blockers`.
- Author downstream prompts to consume that carryover directly. The implementation and planning starters in this repo do that on purpose.
- In the node inspector, use `Reads Context` and `Writes Context` to document that contract in the `.dot` itself instead of keeping it only in prompt prose.

Drive loops with outcome semantics, not prose:

- A node saying “needs fixes” in plain text does not create a retry loop by itself.
- Route retries off real outcomes such as `outcome=fail` and `outcome=success`.
- For Codex-backed review nodes, the most reliable pattern is to return a strict JSON status envelope so the backend can convert the model response into a real Attractor outcome plus `context_updates`.

Example review response shape:

```json
{
  "outcome": "fail",
  "notes": "Implementation is close but missing regression coverage.",
  "failure_reason": "Add tests before landing.",
  "context_updates": {
    "context.review.summary": "Behavior looks correct, but the change is not adequately covered by tests.",
    "context.review.required_changes": "Add a regression test for the changed path and rerun validation.",
    "context.review.blockers": ""
  }
}
```

Be explicit about routing behavior:

- If no conditioned edge matches, Attractor only considers unconditional edges next.
- A false conditioned edge is not a fallback route.
- If a non-failing node has no eligible next edge, the pipeline completes successfully.

Keep parent/child flows portable:

- Use relative `stack.child_dotfile` paths when bundling parent and child flows together.
- Avoid absolute `stack.child_workdir` values in shipped flows unless you really mean to force execution into a specific directory.
- Child flows should be reusable workers; parent flows should add supervision, governance, summary, or escalation rather than duplicating the child's work.

Use hooks and model defaults deliberately:

- A failing `tool.hooks.pre` prevents the tool command from running. Use it only when setup failure should block the tool.
- Use `tool.artifacts.paths`, `tool.artifacts.stdout`, and `tool.artifacts.stderr` when a tool node needs to preserve generated files or captured streams as run artifacts.
- `model_stylesheet` is best for broad model defaults; explicit node attrs still win over stylesheet matches.
- Graph defaults should establish a baseline. Node attrs should capture true per-stage exceptions.

## Architecture

- [src/attractor/](src/attractor): Attractor runtime, pipeline engine, handlers, CLI, and mounted Attractor API
- [src/spark/workspace/](src/spark/workspace): Spark workspace service, conversations, review artifacts, trigger subsystem, and mounted Workspace API
- [src/spark/chat/](src/spark/chat): Spark chat orchestration, prompt templates, session plumbing, and chat response parsing
- [frontend/](frontend): React 19 + Vite UI
- [src/spark/flows/](src/spark/flows): packaged `.dot` flows shipped with Spark; examples live under [src/spark/flows/examples/](src/spark/flows/examples)
- [tests/fixtures/flows/](tests/fixtures/flows): repo-only `.dot` fixtures used by tests and local development
- [tests/](tests): backend tests, UI contracts, and acceptance assets
- [specs/](specs): Attractor, workspace, frontend, and storage specifications

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Graphviz `dot` on `PATH` for graph artifacts
- `codex` CLI on `PATH` with working auth for Codex-backed handlers and project chat flows
- `just` is optional, but the repo commands assume it when available

## Local Development

Prepare a fresh checkout:

```bash
just setup
```

Initialize the runtime tree and seed packaged flows:

```bash
uv run spark-server init
```

`just setup` installs the Python dev environment with `uv sync --dev` and the frontend toolchain with `npm --prefix frontend ci`.

Install a stable wheel into `~/.spark/venv` and initialize the stable runtime:

```bash
just install
```

Start the installed server in the foreground with:

```bash
~/.spark/venv/bin/spark-server serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

On Linux, install and start the background service explicitly with:

```bash
just install-systemd
```

To bind the service on every interface instead of loopback, set `SPARK_HOST=0.0.0.0` when installing it:

```bash
SPARK_HOST=0.0.0.0 just install-systemd
```

You can also bypass `just` and install the user service directly with an explicit host and port:

```bash
~/.spark/venv/bin/spark-server service install --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --data-dir ~/.spark
```

Use `~/.spark/venv/bin/spark-server service status` to inspect it or `~/.spark/venv/bin/spark-server service remove` to stop and unregister it.

Run the full stack locally:

```bash
just dev-run
```

This starts:

- the backend on `127.0.0.1:8010`
- the Vite frontend on `127.0.0.1:5173`

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) for live frontend development.

The source-checkout dev wrapper intentionally uses a separate runtime home and port so it does not stomp on a stable installed Spark instance:

- `SPARK_HOME` defaults to `~/.spark-dev`
- backend port defaults to `8010`

Initialize that dev runtime explicitly with:

```bash
just dev-init
```

For Docker-based development:

```bash
just dev-docker
```

That starts the backend on port `8000` and the frontend on port `5173` via `docker compose`.

The tracked `compose.yaml` is public-safe by default and does not mount personal Codex auth, config, or skills files from your machine.
If you want containerized Codex auth or custom skills, add them in an untracked `compose.override.yaml`, for example:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - /path/to/auth.json:/codex-seed/auth.json:ro
      - /path/to/config.toml:/codex-seed/config.toml:ro
      - /path/to/skills:/codex-runtime/.codex/skills:ro
```

## Backend-Only Usage

Start the server directly:

```bash
uv run spark-server serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Useful development flags:

```bash
uv run spark-server serve \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8000 \
  --reload \
  --data-dir ~/.spark \
  --flows-dir ~/.spark/flows \
  --ui-dir ./frontend/dist
```

When a built UI is available, the backend serves it at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Runtime Data and Configuration

By default, Spark stores runtime data under `~/.spark`:

- `config/`
- `runtime/`
- `logs/`
- `workspace/projects/`
- `attractor/runs/`
- `flows/`

Important path overrides:

- `SPARK_HOME`
- `SPARK_FLOWS_DIR`
- `SPARK_UI_DIR`

`~/.spark/config/prompts.toml` stores user-configurable prompt templates and is created on first startup.

## API Overview

For a task-oriented packaged reference that pairs Spark CLI commands with the matching HTTP routes, use [src/spark/guides/spark-operations.md](src/spark/guides/spark-operations.md).

The canonical route inventory lives in [app.py](src/spark/app.py), [server.py](src/attractor/api/server.py), and [api.py](src/spark/workspace/api.py).

The root app is a mount host only. Canonical public API surfaces are:
- Attractor docs/OpenAPI under `/attractor/docs` and `/attractor/openapi.json`
- Workspace docs/OpenAPI under `/workspace/docs` and `/workspace/openapi.json`

Current API groups include:

- Attractor runtime and runs: `GET /attractor/status`, `GET /attractor/runs`
- Attractor pipeline execution: `POST /attractor/pipelines`, `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}`, `POST /attractor/pipelines/{id}/cancel`
- Attractor pipeline inspection: `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/events`, `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/checkpoint`, `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/context`, `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/graph`, `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/artifacts`
- Attractor human-gate actions: `GET /attractor/pipelines/{id}/questions`, `POST /attractor/pipelines/{id}/questions/{question_id}/answer`
- Attractor flow management: `GET /attractor/api/flows`, `POST /attractor/api/flows`, `GET /attractor/api/flows/{name}`, `DELETE /attractor/api/flows/{name}`
- Workspace project management: `GET /workspace/api/projects`, `POST /workspace/api/projects/register`, `PATCH /workspace/api/projects/state`, `DELETE /workspace/api/projects`
- Workspace triggers and project metadata: `GET /workspace/api/triggers`, `POST /workspace/api/triggers`, `GET /workspace/api/triggers/{trigger_id}`, `PATCH /workspace/api/triggers/{trigger_id}`, `DELETE /workspace/api/triggers/{trigger_id}`, `POST /workspace/api/webhooks`, `GET /workspace/api/projects/metadata`, `GET /workspace/api/projects/browse`
- Workspace conversations: `GET /workspace/api/projects/conversations`, `GET /workspace/api/conversations/{conversation_id}`, `GET /workspace/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events`, `POST /workspace/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/turns`, `DELETE /workspace/api/conversations/{conversation_id}`
- Workspace run-launch workflows: `POST /workspace/api/conversations/by-handle/{conversation_handle}/flow-run-requests`, `POST /workspace/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/flow-run-requests/{request_id}/review`, `POST /workspace/api/runs/launch`

## Repository Commands

Useful `just` targets from [justfile](justfile):

- `just clean`: remove generated build artifacts without deleting installed dependencies or runtime state
- `just setup`: install Python and frontend development dependencies for a fresh checkout
- `just dev-run`: backend + Vite frontend for local development
- `just dev-init`: initialize the source-checkout dev runtime under `~/.spark-dev`
- `just dev-docker`: `docker compose up --build`
- `just test`: full Python test suite
- `just frontend-unit`: frontend unit tests
- `just ui-smoke`: Playwright smoke checks
- `just dot-lint`: DOT formatting lint regression
- `just deliverable`: canonical wheel + sdist packaging workflow with bundled UI verification
- `just build`: compatibility alias for `just deliverable`
- `just install`: install the packaged wheel into `~/.spark/venv` and initialize the stable runtime
- `just install-systemd`: Linux-only install flow that registers the packaged app as a `systemd --user` service

## Testing

Backend suite:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Frontend unit tests:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run test:unit
```

Frontend smoke tests:

```bash
just ui-smoke
```

`just ui-smoke` launches the product ASGI app from [`app.py`](src/spark/app.py), waits for `GET /attractor/status`, and then runs `npm --prefix frontend run ui:smoke`.

## Packaging

From a source checkout, `just dev-run` remains the canonical development path.
For distributable artifacts, use the explicit deliverable workflow:

```bash
just deliverable
```

`just deliverable` builds `frontend/dist`, stages the bundled UI into a temporary packaging tree, builds the wheel and sdist with standard setuptools, and verifies both install paths before copying the artifacts into `dist/`.

`just build` remains available as a compatibility alias, but `just deliverable` is the supported packaging command.

Install the resulting wheel:

```bash
pip install dist/*.whl
```

On Linux, start the installed package as a background user service with:

```bash
spark-server service install
```

## Notes

- Flow files are stored as canonical DOT and validated before save.
- Spark flow self-description lives in DOT via `spark.title` and `spark.description`, while workspace launch policy is stored separately in `~/.spark/config/flow-catalog.toml`.
- Inside the assistant runtime, the Spark agent control surface uses bare `spark` commands such as `spark flow list`, `spark flow describe --flow <name>`, `spark flow get --flow <name>`, `spark flow validate --file <path> --text`, `spark convo run-request ...`, and `spark run launch ...`. In a human source-checkout shell, use `uv run spark ...` instead.
- The editor supports both structured editing and raw DOT editing, including semantic-equivalence safety checks during handoff.
- The Runs view is intended for historical inspection, diagnostics, artifact browsing, and replaying execution context.
- Packaged example flows live in [src/spark/flows/examples/simple-linear.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/simple-linear.dot), [src/spark/flows/examples/implement-review-loop.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/implement-review-loop.dot), [src/spark/flows/examples/human-review-loop.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/human-review-loop.dot), [src/spark/flows/examples/parallel-review.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/parallel-review.dot), [src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/implementation-worker.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/implementation-worker.dot), and [src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/supervised-implementation.dot](src/spark/flows/examples/supervision/supervised-implementation.dot).
- Packaged workflows live in [src/spark/flows/implement-from-plan.dot](src/spark/flows/implement-from-plan.dot), [src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-spec.dot](src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-spec.dot), and [src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-milestone.dot](src/spark/flows/spec-implementation/implement-milestone.dot).
- Repo-only advanced/test fixtures live under [tests/fixtures/flows/](tests/fixtures/flows).
