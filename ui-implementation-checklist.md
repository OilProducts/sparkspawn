# Attractor UI Implementation Checklist

Companion to `/Users/chris/tinker/sparkspawn/ui-spec.md`.

Use this as the execution plan and verification ledger for full UI spec coverage. Tasks are ordered to match the UI spec section/subsection sequence.

Status key:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` complete

---

## 1. Overview and Goals

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- [x] [1.1-01] Document all places where users must leave the UI to raw DOT for required configuration. (See `ui-raw-dot-required-config.md`.)
- [x] [1.1-02] Add a parity-risk report that identifies current behavior-loss and hidden-config failure modes. (See `ui-parity-risk-report.md`.)
- [x] [1.1-03] Add a baseline fixture set of spec-valid flows that currently require raw DOT edits.

### 1.2 Product Goal
- [x] [1.2-01] Define the parity-complete user journey (project-select, author, execute, inspect) as an end-to-end acceptance script.
- [x] [1.2-03] Add release criteria that fail when any required spec feature is unavailable in UI.

### 1.3 Non-Goals
- [x] [1.3-01] Document runtime/parser boundaries so UI work does not alter engine semantics.
- [x] [1.3-02] Add safeguards that prevent invalid DOT synthesis from form states.
- [x] [1.3-03] Keep advanced feature access enabled (no simplified mode removing required spec controls).

---

## 2. Design Principles

- [x] [2-01] Implement spec-first behavior mapping for each UI control with direct spec references. (See `ui-spec-first-behavior-map.md`.)
- [x] [2-02] Add no-silent-loss save protections and user-visible failure states.

## Deferred Tasks

- [ ] [1.2-02] Add CI acceptance checks proving the full journey works without raw DOT fallback.
  Deferred because the required full-journey UI surfaces (project registration/selection and project-scoped conversation/spec/plan flow) are not yet implemented, so a CI proof would be non-representative.
- [ ] [3.1-02] Add role-oriented smoke tests (project onboarding, authoring, live operation, post-run audit).
  Deferred because project onboarding and active-project workflow surfaces from `ui-spec.md` sections 4.2 and 4.3 are not yet implemented, so role smoke tests would be partial and misleading.
- [ ] [3.2-01] Implement workflow guardrails from create/open to iterate/re-run as explicit state machine transitions.
  Deferred because the required project-scoped workflow surfaces (project registry/Git gating, conversation/spec loop, and spec->plan->build chain) are not yet implemented in the UI.
- [ ] [3.2-02] Add test coverage for the full 12-step primary workflow sequence (project registration/selection through re-run).
  Deferred because the project registration/Git gating and project-scoped conversation/spec/plan/run surfaces required by `ui-spec.md` section 3.2 are not yet implemented for behavioral end-to-end coverage.
- [ ] [3.2-03] Ensure every step has a first-class UI surface (no hidden or CLI-only transition).
  Deferred because the required project-scoped conversation/spec/plan/build surfaces are not implemented yet, so the workflow still has unavoidable non-UI transitions.
- [ ] [3.2-04] Add explicit workflow coverage for project-scoped AI conversation -> spec refinement -> plan generation/approval -> build execution chain.
  Deferred because the project-scoped conversation/spec/plan/build chain is not fully implemented, so coverage would only validate placeholders instead of the real workflow.
- [ ] [4-02] Add deterministic deep-link state for active project/flow/run/conversation and panel selection.
  Deferred because active-project identity and project-scoped conversation state are not implemented yet, so full deep-link determinism cannot be validated end-to-end.
- [ ] [4.2-02] Enforce Git-repository requirement before workflow execution (with explicit initialize path when user confirms).
  Deferred because the current API/UI contract has no project Git verification/initialize endpoint path yet, so the required enforcement and explicit initialization flow cannot be implemented correctly.
- [ ] [4.3-03] Implement Git verification UI with explicit initialize action path.
  Deferred because the frontend currently has no project Git verification/initialize API contract to drive real status checks or an explicit initialize action flow.
- [ ] [5.4-02] Inject active project directory and repository metadata into AI conversation context.
  Deferred because the request pipeline for real AI conversation payloads is still not implemented, so there is no concrete backend-bound conversation context path to inject this metadata into yet.
- [ ] [6.4-01] Add subgraph creation, labeling, and membership editing UI.
  Deferred because the current frontend/API flow model only returns flattened nodes/edges and lacks subgraph/default-scope structures needed for first-class membership editing.
- [ ] [6.4-02] Add scoped `node[...]` and `edge[...]` defaults authoring controls.
  Deferred because the current frontend/API payload and DOT serializer do not model scoped default blocks, so this control cannot be implemented without first adding subgraph/default-scope primitives.
- [ ] [6.4-03] Visualize inherited vs explicit attrs at node/edge level.
  Deferred because inherited-versus-explicit visualization depends on subgraph membership and scoped defaults that are currently flattened out by the frontend/API model and serializer.
- [ ] [6.4-04] Add support for derived class behavior from subgraph labels.
  Deferred because derived class behavior depends on subgraph creation/membership and scoped default infrastructure (`6.4-01` to `6.4-03`) that is not yet modeled in the frontend.
- [ ] [6.4-05] Add round-trip tests preserving subgraph/default-block semantics.
  Deferred because the current frontend/API model and serializer flatten subgraph/default scopes, so the test would fail on known model loss instead of catching regressions.
- [ ] [8.2-02] Provide Pause/Resume controls when backend/API supports them.
  Deferred because the current UI/API contract only exposes `/pipelines/{id}/cancel` with no pause/resume endpoint or capability metadata to drive those controls safely.
