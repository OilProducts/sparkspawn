# Spark Frontend

This directory contains the React 19 + Vite frontend for Spark.

The UI is responsible for:

- project registration and project-scoped Home workflows
- conversation threads, flow-run request review, and direct flow launches
- DOT authoring in both structured and raw modes
- execution controls, live run streaming, and run inspection
- settings, diagnostics, and responsive shell layout

## Development

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the Vite dev server proxies API requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
Override that with `VITE_BACKEND_URL` if needed.

From the repo root, `just run` is the normal full-stack workflow.

## Shared UI Boundary

- The shadcn CLI source of truth is `src/components/ui`.
- Spark-managed shared wrappers such as dialog control, panels, notices, and shared flow browsing live in `src/components/app`.
- Import shared UI by direct module path under `@/components/ui/*` or `@/components/app/*`, not through a mixed barrel.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build`: type-check and produce a production build in `dist/`
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally
- `npm run shadcn:verify`: verify `components.json` and the shadcn-managed primitives against the pinned repo-local baseline, including `native-select`, without depending on live `shadcn@latest` network calls at evaluation time
- `npm run test:unit`: run Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:unit:watch`: run Vitest in watch mode
- `npm run ui:smoke`: run Playwright smoke checks

`npm run ui:smoke` expects the product backend to already be serving on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
From the repo root, use `just ui-smoke` to launch [`app.py`](/Users/chris/projects/spark/src/spark_app/app.py) and wait for `/attractor/status` automatically before Playwright starts.

## Build Output

Production assets are emitted to `frontend/dist/`.
When building the Python package from the repo root, `uv build` or `just build` bundles `frontend/dist` into the wheel and sdist automatically:

```bash
just build
```
