# Spark Spawn UI/UX Specification

This document is the canonical operator-facing client specification for Spark Spawn.

It consolidates and supersedes the split UI documents:
- `sparkspawn-frontend.md`
- `ui-user-stories.md`
- `ui-story-records.md`

## 1. Purpose

The Spark Spawn frontend is the operator-facing application for:
- project-scoped collaboration
- flow authoring
- run inspection
- human review and approval of workspace artifacts

The frontend composes workspace data from Spark Spawn and execution data from Attractor without becoming either of them.

## 2. Scope and Design Intent

Spark Spawn is organized around a home-first, project-scoped operator workflow:
- select a project
- collaborate in project chat
- review artifacts
- author or inspect flows
- monitor and inspect runs

Story material exists to support implementation, testing, and auditing. It does not override the normative client contract sections below.

## 3. Relationship to Workspace and Attractor

The frontend intentionally targets two distinct backend surfaces:
- Spark Spawn Workspace for project, conversation, and review data
- Attractor for flow and run data

Workspace artifacts and Attractor runs remain conceptually separate even when the UI shows them side by side.

## 4. Client Boundaries

### 4.1 The Frontend Is Not the Engine

The frontend does not execute pipelines.

It consumes Attractor through API surfaces for:
- run submission
- status
- event streams
- questions
- checkpoint, context, graph, and artifacts

### 4.2 The Frontend Is Not the Workspace Source of Truth

The frontend does not durably own:
- projects
- conversations
- proposals
- execution cards
- review decisions
- provenance links

### 4.3 No Hidden Local Authority

The frontend must not persist local state that overrides backend truth for:
- which artifacts exist
- whether an artifact was approved
- which run an artifact launched
- which flow a trigger resolves to

When local state becomes invalid relative to backend state, the backend wins.

## 5. Data Sources and Service Separation

### 5.1 Workspace Data

The frontend consumes workspace data for:
- project list and active project
- project conversations
- inline conversation artifacts
- proposal and execution-card review state
- trigger bindings
- provenance references to flows and runs

### 5.2 Attractor Data

The frontend consumes Attractor data for:
- flows
- run list
- run status
- run events
- checkpoint
- context
- graph render
- questions
- artifacts

### 5.3 Separation Rule

The frontend must preserve the conceptual separation between:
- workspace artifacts
- Attractor runs

Workflow launch flow selection comes from workspace bindings or explicit operator overrides. It must not be inferred from whichever flow happens to be open in the editor.

## 6. Primary User Workflows

The primary workflows are:
- Home and project selection
- project-scoped conversation and artifact review
- flow authoring and validation
- execution monitoring
- run inspection

These workflow summaries are normative at the experience level. Detailed story records remain appendix-style support material.

## 7. Navigation Model

Home is the default top-level workspace for:
- project selection
- project framing
- AI collaboration

Navigation should preserve project framing as the operator moves from conversation to execution and run inspection whenever that framing still applies.

## 8. Presentation Surfaces

### 8.1 Workspace Surfaces

Workspace-oriented surfaces include:
- project selection
- conversation list
- project chat
- inline spec proposal cards
- inline flow-run request cards
- inline execution cards
- review controls

### 8.2 Attractor Surfaces

Attractor-oriented surfaces include:
- flow editing and validation
- run history
- run event timeline
- checkpoint view
- context view
- graph view
- artifact inspection
- human-question answering

### 8.3 Bridge Surfaces

Bridge surfaces show how workspace artifacts connect to Attractor execution.

These are provenance views, not ownership transfers.

## 9. Project Selection UX

The UI should support:
- one active project at a time
- visible active project identity
- duplicate-path prevention
- project metadata visible enough for safe selection
- recent or favorite project switching when supported

Project identity itself remains workspace truth even though the UI presents it.

## 10. Conversation UX

The frontend renders project chat from the workspace conversation contract rather than from raw model protocol messages.

The conversation surface should show:
- user turns
- assistant turns
- thinking or reasoning blocks
- tool activity
- inline workspace artifacts such as spec proposals, flow-run requests, and execution cards

Conversation UX commitments include:
- an assistant row should appear promptly after the user sends a message
- progressive assistant output should stream into that row when available
- tool-call rows may appear before, between, or after assistant text updates without breaking timeline order
- a placeholder such as `Thinking...` may remain until the first assistant text arrives
- final completion should finalize the active assistant row rather than append a duplicate
- failure should convert the active assistant row into an explicit failure state or remove it cleanly

The UI must not reconstruct chat cards from raw protocol notifications.

## 11. Review and Approval UX

Spec edit proposal approval, flow-run request approval, and execution-card approval are explicit human actions.

The UI must present these as review controls, not as automatic assistant continuations.

When approval causes downstream execution, the UI should display:
- what artifact was approved
- what flow was launched
- what Attractor run id was created
- an affordance to open the resulting run

The UI must not imply approval unless the backend has recorded it explicitly.

## 12. Flow Authoring UX

Flow authoring is a client experience layered on top of Attractor contracts.

The UI may provide:
- structured editing
- raw DOT editing
- validation visibility
- preview and save workflows
- degraded-state feedback when API or validation calls fail

This section is about the authoring experience, not the DOT DSL itself.

## 13. Run Inspection UX

The run inspector is a frontend for Attractor runs, not for workspace artifacts.

It should render:
- run summary
- event timeline
- checkpoint
- context
- graph
- artifacts
- pending questions when present

When the user reaches run inspection from a workspace surface, the UI should preserve project framing by default rather than dropping into an unscoped global run context.

## 14. Frontend State Model

The frontend treats backend-provided state as authoritative for:
- project identity
- conversation identity
- artifact status
- run identity and run status
- provenance links

The frontend may keep local ephemeral state for:
- selected tab
- expanded or collapsed cards
- active inspector panel
- currently inspected run
- draft message text
- local filter or sort controls

## 15. Error, Degraded, and Partial-Availability UX

When a backend surface is unavailable or incompatible:
- the affected UI should enter an explicit degraded state
- unaffected surfaces should remain usable where feasible
- the client must not fabricate missing authority from stale local state
- save and launch paths should remain non-destructive

Degraded behavior is part of the operator contract, not an implementation accident.

## 16. Accessibility and Responsiveness Expectations

The UI should preserve core workflows across:
- desktop and narrow/mobile layouts
- keyboard-accessible review and navigation flows where supported
- readable project framing and status visibility in constrained layouts

Only durable, testable UX expectations belong here.

## 17. User Story Catalog

The current stable story groups are:
- Home workspace and project selection
- project-scoped AI conversation and spec editing
- spec -> plan -> work tracker -> build chain
- governance, safety, and auditability
- UX and information architecture implications

Story IDs remain useful for traceability and test planning, but the catalog does not create independent backend truth.

## 18. Detailed Story Records

Detailed story records remain useful for:
- rationale
- acceptance criteria
- non-goals
- implementation intent
- references

Those records are appendix-style support material. They should clarify or trace the normative UX sections, not replace them.

## 19. Traceability to Workspace and Attractor Contracts

Each substantial UI obligation should be traceable back to:
- a workspace contract section
- an Attractor contract section
- or a clearly identified client-only UX requirement

That traceability exists to prevent:
- UX sections from quietly redefining backend truth
- stories from becoming a second source of authority
- implementation intent from being mistaken for normative contract language
