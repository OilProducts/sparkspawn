# Specs

This directory contains the canonical target-state documents for Spark Spawn, plus the referenced Attractor source specification.

These files define the program we are building:
- core product and runtime specifications
- user stories and detailed story records
- selected target-behavior adjuncts such as boundaries

Execution artifacts stay outside this folder:
- checklists
- migration plans
- risk reports
- gap inventories
- implementation notes

  Core runtime and DSL specification.
- `sparkspawn-attractor-extensions.md`
