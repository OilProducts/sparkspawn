## 1. Overview and Goals

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- [x] [1.1-01] Implement at least one reference workflow that chains multiple LLM stages with conditions, human approval, and parallel execution.
- [x] [1.1-02] Verify workflows are defined as graph structure (nodes/edges/attrs), not imperative control flow code.
- [x] [1.1-03] Add a deterministic replay test proving identical routing given identical outcomes/context.

### 1.2 Why DOT Syntax
- [x] [1.2-01] Restrict ingestion to DOT `digraph` workflows and reject unsupported DOT features.
- [x] [1.2-02] Add visualization export path (DOT -> Graphviz render artifact) for operator inspection.
- [x] [1.2-03] Validate `.dot` files are diff-friendly in CI (format/lint check with stable ordering).

### 1.3 Design Principles
- [x] [1.3-01] Enforce declarative execution model: engine chooses runtime flow from graph + outcomes.
- [x] [1.3-02] Ensure handler system is pluggable and registry-driven.
- [x] [1.3-03] Persist checkpoint after each stage and support resume from checkpoint.
- [x] [1.3-04] Support human-gate decision points with external interviewer implementations.
- [x] [1.3-05] Keep routing edge-driven (conditions/labels/weights), not handler-internal branching.

### 1.4 Layering and LLM Backends
- [x] [1.4-01] Keep orchestration layer backend-agnostic via `CodergenBackend` interface.
- [x] [1.4-02] Ensure pipeline definition is backend-invariant (switch backend without DOT changes).
- [~] [1.4-03] Emit runtime events suitable for TUI/web/IDE consumers with no UI coupling in engine.

## Release Gate Checklist
- [ ] [RG-01] Every subsection above has at least one completed implementation task.
- [ ] [RG-02] Every DoD matrix item (Section 11 + parity matrix) is linked to an automated test or explicit manual test record.
- [ ] [RG-03] API contract matches Section 9.5 endpoints and SSE semantics.
- [ ] [RG-04] Artifact directory and status file contract validations pass on integration smoke run.

## Deferred Tasks
- [ ] [2.6-02] Resolve `type` override before shape-based handler mapping. Deferred because `HandlerRegistry.resolve_handler_type` already checks explicit `type` before shape mapping and tests already cover this precedence (`tests/handlers/test_handlers.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.8-02] Ensure explicit `type` attribute overrides shape mapping. Deferred because explicit `type` precedence is already implemented in `HandlerRegistry.resolve_handler_type` and validated by `tests/handlers/test_handlers.py::test_registry_resolution_by_shape_and_type`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.3-05] Accept optional statement semicolons. Deferred because parser behavior is already implemented and covered by existing tests (`tests/dsl/test_parser.py`), so this is checklist state drift rather than a code gap.
- [ ] [2.4-02] Parse signed integers and floats. Deferred because signed integer/float parsing is already implemented in `attractor/dsl/parser.py` and exercised by parser tests, so this item is currently non-actionable checklist drift.
- [ ] [2.7-01] Implement edge `label` for preferred-label routing. Deferred because preferred-label edge routing is already implemented in `attractor/engine/routing.py` and covered by `tests/engine/test_routing.py::test_preferred_label_then_suggested_ids`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.7-03] Implement `weight` for deterministic prioritization. Deferred because deterministic weight routing is already implemented in `attractor/engine/routing.py` (`_best_by_weight_then_lexical`) and covered by `tests/engine/test_routing.py::test_weight_then_lexical_tiebreak_for_unconditional`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.9-01] Expand chained declarations into pairwise edges. Deferred because parser chain expansion already emits pairwise edges in `attractor/dsl/parser.py::parse_node_or_edge` and is covered by parser tests (`tests/dsl/test_parser.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.10-01] Flatten subgraph wrappers while preserving contained nodes/edges. Deferred because `parse_statement` already flattens subgraph bodies directly into the top-level `DotGraph` in `attractor/dsl/parser.py`, and the remaining explicit edge-retention coverage gap is better tracked under parser DoD test-conversion work (`11.1-01`) than this implementation task.
- [ ] [2.10-02] Apply subgraph-local defaults to enclosed nodes unless overridden. Deferred because parser subgraph scoping already applies `node [...]` defaults via child scope inheritance in `attractor/dsl/parser.py` and parser coverage exists in `tests/dsl/test_parser.py::test_parse_subgraph_scope_defaults`, so this is checklist state drift.
