## 1. Overview and Goals

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- [x] [1.1-01] Implement at least one reference workflow that chains multiple LLM stages with conditions, human approval, and parallel execution.
- [x] [1.1-02] Verify workflows are defined as graph structure (nodes/edges/attrs), not imperative control flow code.
- [x] [1.1-03] Add a deterministic replay test proving identical routing given identical outcomes/context.

### 1.2 Why DOT Syntax
- [x] [1.2-01] Restrict ingestion to DOT `digraph` workflows and reject unsupported DOT features.
- [x] [1.2-02] Add visualization export path (DOT -> Graphviz render artifact) for operator inspection.
- [x] [1.2-03] Validate `.dot` files are diff-friendly in CI (format/lint check with stable ordering).

### 1.3 Design Principles
- [x] [1.3-01] Enforce declarative execution model: engine chooses runtime flow from graph + outcomes.
- [x] [1.3-02] Ensure handler system is pluggable and registry-driven.
- [x] [1.3-03] Persist checkpoint after each stage and support resume from checkpoint.
- [x] [1.3-04] Support human-gate decision points with external interviewer implementations.
- [x] [1.3-05] Keep routing edge-driven (conditions/labels/weights), not handler-internal branching.

### 1.4 Layering and LLM Backends
- [x] [1.4-01] Keep orchestration layer backend-agnostic via `CodergenBackend` interface.
- [x] [1.4-02] Ensure pipeline definition is backend-invariant (switch backend without DOT changes).
- [x] [1.4-03] Emit runtime events suitable for TUI/web/IDE consumers with no UI coupling in engine.

## Deferred Tasks
- [ ] [9.6-04] Emit interview lifecycle events. Deferred because interview events are already emitted by `WaitHumanHandler` (`InterviewStarted`, `InterviewCompleted`, `InterviewTimeout`) and covered by executor runtime-event tests (`tests/engine/test_executor.py::test_executor_emits_parallel_and_interview_runtime_events`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [9.6-05] Emit checkpoint-saved events. Deferred because `PipelineExecutor._save_checkpoint` already emits `CheckpointSaved` and engine tests assert those events (`tests/engine/test_checkpointing.py`, `tests/engine/test_executor.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [9.6-06] Support observer callback consumption and streaming consumption. Deferred because observer callbacks are already supported via `PipelineExecutor(on_event=...)` and stream consumption is already exposed by `GET /pipelines/{id}/events` SSE with endpoint tests (`tests/api/test_pipeline_events_endpoint.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [9.1-01] Implement transform interface (`apply(graph) -> graph`) and pipeline execution order. Deferred because the transform protocol and ordered pipeline execution are already implemented (`attractor/transforms/base.py`, `attractor/transforms/pipeline.py`) and covered by transform/API tests (`tests/transforms/test_transforms.py::test_transform_pipeline_order`, `tests/api/test_validation_diagnostics.py::test_start_pipeline_runs_stylesheet_transform_before_validation`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [8.4-02] Apply provider keys for `llm_provider`. Deferred because stylesheet application already supports `llm_provider` declarations in `ModelStylesheetTransform`, and transform tests already assert provider propagation/precedence (`tests/transforms/test_transforms.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [8.3-02] Implement specificity ordering and tie-break by later rule of equal specificity. Deferred because `ModelStylesheetTransform` already compares `(specificity, rule.order)` when choosing candidate declarations (`attractor/transforms/stylesheet.py`), and transform tests already assert later-rule wins for equal-specificity selectors (`tests/transforms/test_transforms.py::test_stylesheet_multiple_matching_classes_use_rule_order_for_equal_specificity`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [8.3-01] Implement selector matching for `*`, `.class`, and `#node_id`. Deferred because `ModelStylesheetTransform` already matches universal/class/id selectors in `attractor/transforms/stylesheet.py::_selector_matches`, and transform tests cover each selector type (`tests/transforms/test_transforms.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [8.1-01] Parse stylesheet from graph attribute and apply as defaults-only transform. Deferred because `ModelStylesheetTransform` already reads `graph.graph_attrs["model_stylesheet"]` and applies inferred model attrs as defaults-only (preserving explicit node attrs), and this is covered by `tests/transforms/test_transforms.py` stylesheet transform cases.
- [ ] [7.2-03] Implement `reachability` rule. Deferred because `validate_graph` already emits `reachability` diagnostics for nodes outside the start-node traversal and this behavior is covered by validator tests (`tests/dsl/test_validator.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [6.4-03] Implement `CallbackInterviewer` delegation path. Deferred because `CallbackInterviewer.ask` already delegates directly to the injected callback and this behavior is covered in `tests/interviewer/test_interviewer.py::test_callback_interviewer`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [5.6-02] Ensure each stage directory includes `prompt.md`, `response.md`, `status.json`. Deferred because executor stage artifact writes already guarantee all three files per executed stage (`attractor/engine/executor.py::_write_stage_artifacts`), and coverage exists in `tests/engine/test_checkpointing.py::test_artifacts_and_checkpoint_written_each_step`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [4.2-01] Implement registration API with replacement behavior for duplicate keys. Deferred because `HandlerRegistry.register` already replaces existing entries via direct map assignment and this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.6-02] Resolve `type` override before shape-based handler mapping. Deferred because `HandlerRegistry.resolve_handler_type` already checks explicit `type` before shape mapping and tests already cover this precedence (`tests/handlers/test_handlers.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.8-02] Ensure explicit `type` attribute overrides shape mapping. Deferred because explicit `type` precedence is already implemented in `HandlerRegistry.resolve_handler_type` and validated by `tests/handlers/test_handlers.py::test_registry_resolution_by_shape_and_type`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.3-05] Accept optional statement semicolons. Deferred because parser behavior is already implemented and covered by existing tests (`tests/dsl/test_parser.py`), so this is checklist state drift rather than a code gap.
- [ ] [2.4-02] Parse signed integers and floats. Deferred because signed integer/float parsing is already implemented in `attractor/dsl/parser.py` and exercised by parser tests, so this item is currently non-actionable checklist drift.
- [ ] [2.7-01] Implement edge `label` for preferred-label routing. Deferred because preferred-label edge routing is already implemented in `attractor/engine/routing.py` and covered by `tests/engine/test_routing.py::test_preferred_label_then_suggested_ids`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.7-03] Implement `weight` for deterministic prioritization. Deferred because deterministic weight routing is already implemented in `attractor/engine/routing.py` (`_best_by_weight_then_lexical`) and covered by `tests/engine/test_routing.py::test_weight_then_lexical_tiebreak_for_unconditional`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.9-01] Expand chained declarations into pairwise edges. Deferred because parser chain expansion already emits pairwise edges in `attractor/dsl/parser.py::parse_node_or_edge` and is covered by parser tests (`tests/dsl/test_parser.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [2.10-01] Flatten subgraph wrappers while preserving contained nodes/edges. Deferred because `parse_statement` already flattens subgraph bodies directly into the top-level `DotGraph` in `attractor/dsl/parser.py`, and the remaining explicit edge-retention coverage gap is better tracked under parser DoD test-conversion work (`11.1-01`) than this implementation task.
- [ ] [2.10-02] Apply subgraph-local defaults to enclosed nodes unless overridden. Deferred because parser subgraph scoping already applies `node [...]` defaults via child scope inheritance in `attractor/dsl/parser.py` and parser coverage exists in `tests/dsl/test_parser.py::test_parse_subgraph_scope_defaults`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [3.3-02] Implement normalized preferred-label matching (case/trim/accelerator stripping). Deferred because label normalization (case/trim/accelerator prefix stripping) is already implemented in `attractor/engine/routing.py::_normalize_label` and exercised by `tests/engine/test_routing.py::test_preferred_label_then_suggested_ids`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [3.3-04] Implement weight-descending selection for unconditional edges. Deferred because unconditional-edge routing already uses descending `weight` selection via `attractor/engine/routing.py::_best_by_weight_then_lexical` and is covered by routing tests, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [3.7-01] Route fail outcomes to fail-edge (`condition="outcome=fail"`) when present. Deferred because fail-edge prioritization for `FAIL` outcomes is already implemented in `attractor/engine/executor.py::_select_route_edge` and covered by `tests/engine/test_retry_goal_gate.py::test_failure_routing_prefers_outcome_fail_edge_over_other_true_conditions`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [4.8-04] Serialize branch results into `parallel.results`. Deferred because `ParallelHandler` already emits `context_updates["parallel.results"]` and existing tests assert populated branch-result payloads (`tests/handlers/test_handlers.py`, `tests/integration/test_parity_matrix.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [4.9-01] Read `parallel.results` and fail when empty. Deferred because `FanInHandler.execute` already reads `parallel.results` and returns `FAIL` with `"No parallel results to evaluate"` when normalized results are empty, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [4.9-04] Publish selected candidate via `parallel.fan_in.*` context keys. Deferred because `FanInHandler.execute` already sets `parallel.fan_in.best_id` and `parallel.fan_in.best_outcome`, and tests assert both keys in `tests/handlers/test_handlers.py`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [4.12-01] Document and support custom handler registration by type string. Deferred because type-string registration is already implemented in `HandlerRegistry.register` and exercised by custom-type resolution coverage (`tests/handlers/test_handlers.py`, `tests/integration/test_parity_matrix.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [5.4-02] Implement fidelity precedence: edge -> target node -> graph default -> `compact`. Deferred because `PipelineExecutor._resolve_runtime_fidelity` already enforces this precedence (including `compact` fallback), and executor fidelity tests already cover edge/node/graph precedence, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [7.1-02] Block execution when any ERROR diagnostic exists. Deferred because pipeline start already aborts on error-severity diagnostics in `attractor/api/server.py::_start_pipeline`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [7.2-06] Implement `exit_no_outgoing` rule. Deferred because `validate_graph` already emits `exit_no_outgoing` diagnostics for terminal nodes with outgoing edges and validator coverage exists in `tests/dsl/test_validator.py::test_edge_target_exists_and_start_incoming_exit_outgoing`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [7.2-10] Implement `fidelity_valid` warning rule. Deferred because fidelity warnings for graph/node/edge attrs are already implemented in `attractor/dsl/validator.py::_validate_fidelity_values` and covered by `tests/dsl/test_validator.py::test_retry_target_and_fidelity_warnings`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [7.2-11] Implement `retry_target_exists` warning rule. Deferred because `validate_graph` already emits `retry_target_exists` diagnostics for graph/node retry targets that reference missing nodes (`attractor/dsl/validator.py::_validate_retry_targets`) and this behavior is covered in `tests/dsl/test_validator.py::test_retry_target_and_fidelity_warnings`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [10.1-01] Keep expression language minimal and deterministic for routing. Deferred because this is an umbrella outcome that should be closed only after the concrete grammar/semantics/evaluation tasks in Sections 10.2-10.5 are completed.
- [ ] [10.3-01] Evaluate clauses left-to-right with logical AND semantics. Deferred because `evaluate_condition` already evaluates clauses in source order and short-circuits on first false clause (`attractor/engine/conditions.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [10.3-02] Treat missing context keys as empty string. Deferred because `context.*` resolution already returns `""` for missing keys via `Context.get_context_path`, and existing condition tests cover missing-key behavior, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [10.5-01] Return true for empty condition. Deferred because `evaluate_condition` already returns true for empty strings in `attractor/engine/conditions.py`, and this is covered by `tests/engine/test_conditions.py::test_empty_condition_true`, so this is checklist state drift.
- [ ] [10.5-02] Evaluate `!=` and `=` clauses correctly. Deferred because `evaluate_condition` already applies exact `=`/`!=` comparisons and evaluator tests cover both operators across outcome/context/quoted literals (`attractor/engine/conditions.py`, `tests/engine/test_conditions.py`), so this is checklist state drift.
